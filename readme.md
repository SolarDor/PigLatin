## Description

_This is a simple webpage project to practice using arrays and loops. Users enter a word or sentence into the form, which is then transformed into pig latin and printed to the screen._

## Specifications for Pig Latin
1. Behavior: For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.
Input: "at enter i"
Output: "atway enterway iway"

2. Behavior: For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".
Input: "pig latin"
Output: "igpay  atinlay"

3. Behavior: If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!

Output: "ietquay ealsquay"

4. Behavior: For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.
